📹 Use your GoPro for RTMP streaming – reliable 🧲

# Installing

## Getting started

- Raspberry Pi with [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (Lite has better performance because there is less overhead) [installed](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md). Make sure you have Internet on the Ethernet port, as WiFi is used to communicate with the GoPro Camera. Create an empty file named «ssh» on the boot partition to [enable ssh access](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md).
- Connect to your Pi via SSH, head over to the [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md) if you need help.
- TODO: Curl?
- One-Step Automated Install: Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install Pi-hole using the following command:
  `curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`. [Piping to `bash` is controversial](https://pi-hole.net/2016/07/25/curling-and-piping-to-bash), as it prevents you from [reading code that is about to run](https://github.com/martinschilliger/Adelbach/master/auto_install/install.sh) on your system.
